# Designed By Few 2016 Website
Each year Few hosts Made By Few. An annual festival and conference that brings together creative individuals from all over the world. The focus of the conference is to provide a platform for people to come together, inspire each other, and build new relationships. As a part of this conference, we have a design competition that brings the community together to socialize and learn a little about other peoples design process. -- I designed an announcement website to share information about this event. And to give people a place to register to compete.
